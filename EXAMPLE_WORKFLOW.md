# Project Analyzer - Progressive Documentation Creation Examples

This document demonstrates how to use the project-analyzer skill for progressive analysis, creating independent documents for each topic.

## 🎯 Analysis Example: Analyzing Local Kubernetes Project

When the user says "Analyze /Users/ccc/work/todo/kubernetes", the skill will execute the following process:

### 📋 Initialization Phase

```
🔍 Starting analysis of local Kubernetes project...

📁 Creating analysis directory structure (inside the project being analyzed):
/Users/ccc/work/todo/kubernetes/ai-analysis-docs/
├── kubernetes-analysis.md
├── kubernetes-progress-tracking.md
├── analysis-todo.md
├── changelog.md
├── topics/
└── assets/

📊 Analysis Mode: Standard Analysis (12 topics)
🎯 Start Time: 2026-03-09 14:30:00
📍 Project Path: /Users/ccc/work/todo/kubernetes
📂 Analysis Documents: ai-analysis-docs/ directory within the project
```

---

### ✅ Topic 1: Project Basic Information

**Analysis Phase**:
- Analyze local file system: file count, directory structure
- Detect main programming languages: Go file statistics
- Analyze README file and project description
- Check license file

**Save Phase**:
```
💾 Creating document: /Users/ccc/work/todo/kubernetes/ai-analysis-docs/topics/01-project-basic-info.md
   (Note: Documents are saved inside the project being analyzed)
```

**Update Phase**:
- Update `kubernetes-progress-tracking.md`: Mark Topic 1 as completed
- Update `analysis-todo.md`: Update progress status
- Update `kubernetes-analysis.md`: Add Project Basic Information section
- Update `changelog.md`: Record document creation activity

**Report Phase**:
```
✅ Project Basic Information completed (progress 1/12)

Key findings:

• License: Apache 2.0
• Project type: Local project

📄 Topic document: topics/01-project-basic-info.md
📝 Updated changelog.md

🔄 Continuing to next topic...
```

**Continue Immediately**: Automatically start "Project Structure" topic analysis without waiting for user confirmation

---

### ✅ Topic 2: Project Structure

**Analysis Phase**:
- Analyze local directory structure: cmd/, pkg/, staging/
- Identify main modules: kube-apiserver, kubelet, kube-proxy
- Create component relationship diagrams
- Count code lines in each directory

**Save Phase**:
```
💾 Creating document: /Users/ccc/work/todo/kubernetes/ai-analysis-docs/topics/02-project-structure.md
```

**Update Phase**:
- Update progress tracking: Mark Topic 2 as completed
- Update analysis-todo.md: Update progress status

- Automatically generate links between documents
- Automatically integrate main report

### Key Behavioral Characteristics

**Automation First**:
- ✅ Report immediately after completing each topic
- ✅ Automatically start next topic after reporting
- ✅ Don't wait for user confirmation or approval
- ✅ Complete all topics unless user says "stop"

**Transparency**:
- ✅ Each topic has progress indicator (X/12)
- ✅ Real-time reporting of key findings
- ✅ Clear document locations
- ✅ Users can check progress document anytime

**User Control**:
- ✅ Users can say "stop" at any time to interrupt analysis
- ✅ Users can view completed documents anytime
- ✅ Users can request to skip certain topics
- ✅ Users can request to dive deeper into specific topics

This progressive documentation creation strategy ensures reliability, transparency, and excellent user experience during the analysis process, while minimizing user interaction burden.
