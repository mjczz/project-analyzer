# Project Analyzer Heartbeat Test

This document demonstrates how the heartbeat detection system works in the project-analyzer skill.

## Test Scenario

Simulate a project analysis that gets interrupted and then resumed.

## Initial Analysis Start

```markdown
## Project Analysis Started: test-project

**Status**: 🟢 In Progress
**Mode**: Standard Analysis
**Started**: 2026-03-09 14:30:00
**Project Path**: /Users/ccc/test-project
**Analysis ID**: test-project-20260309-143000

**Progress**: 0/12 topics completed

**Next Topic**: Project Basic Info
```

## After Completing First 3 Topics

```markdown
### 🔄 Topic Update: Project Structure

**Progress**: 3/12 topics completed
**Current Topic**: Project Structure
**Status**: Completed
**Updated**: 2026-03-09 14:45:22

**Files Created**:
- /Users/ccc/test-project/ai-analysis-docs/topics/01-project-basic-info.md
- /Users/ccc/test-project/ai-analysis-docs/topics/02-project-structure.md
- /Users/ccc/test-project/ai-analysis-docs/topics/03-tech-stack.md
- /Users/ccc/test-project/ai-analysis-docs/test-project-analysis.md

**Next Topic**: Core Features
```

## Simulated Interruption

```markdown
## ⚠️ Analysis Interrupted: test-project

**Status**: 🟡 Paused
**Last Update**: 2026-03-09 14:52:18
**Progress**: 3/12 topics completed
**Last Completed Topic**: Tech Stack
**Next Topic**: Core Features

**Resume Instructions**: Use "resume analysis of /Users/ccc/test-project" to continue from topic 4
```

## Resume and Completion

When the user resumes the analysis, the heartbeat system:
1. Detects the interrupted analysis from memory
2. Restores progress state (3/12 completed)
3. Continues from topic 4 (Core Features)
4. Completes remaining topics
5. Writes final completion entry

## Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Interruption Recovery**: Analysis can continue from where it left off
2. **Progress Visibility**: Clear indication of what has been completed
3. **File Safety**: Already created documents are preserved
4. **State Management**: No loss of analysis context
5. **User Experience**: Seamless resume without repeating work

## Memory Footprint

Each heartbeat entry is approximately 200-300 bytes, making it very lightweight:
- Start entry: ~150 bytes
- Per topic updates: ~250 bytes each (2 per topic)
- Completion entry: ~200 bytes
- Total for standard analysis: ~6 KB for 12 topics

## Integration Points

The heartbeat system integrates with:
- **OpenClaw Memory**: Uses `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for persistence
- **Analysis Workflow**: Embedded in Step 0, each topic, and Final Step
- **Resume Logic**: Enables continuation from interruption points
- **Progress Tracking**: Complements `analysis-todo.md` file tracking
